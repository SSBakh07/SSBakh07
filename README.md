Hi! I'm Sheedeh Sharif-Bakhtiar and I'm an extremely passionate deep learning engineer currently based in Tehran, Iran. I've been a freelance software developer and AI engineer for about 6 years now and I love working on new projects and learning new skills.


### Facts about me:
- I'm Iranian-Canadian, and English is my first language, with Persian (Farsi) being my second language.
- I'm fascinated by all things AI, and I'm looking to get a phd in this field as I am *deeply* passionate about research!
- In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with Discord bots, and writing fiction.

### Publications (so far):
- [Optimizing Complex Ensembles: Automatic Bias-Variance Tuning with SVM-Based Learners - Amir Hussein Ataei Monfared; Sheedeh Sharif-Bakhtiar](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10475226)

<br />
<em>(More to come!)</em>

### Education:
- MSc. in data science at Shahid Beheshti University (2021-2023)
     - My thesis was on applying visual transformers to predict the USD/EUR market (Forex). This was done by encoding temporal OHLC data into an image, and feeding that to several transformer-based encoders.
- BSc. in computer engineering at Islamic Azad University (2018-2020)
     - My final project was on swarm pathfinding (robotics) and designing an intelligent "manager" agent to prevent collisions while keeping things as efficient as possible.


### Skills:
- Pytorch
- FastAPI
- OpenCV
- MongoDB, Docker, 
- Vuejs, Reactjs, Nextjs

### Additional experience:
- I had the privilege of TA-ing for Professor Hadi Farahani's advanced machine learning (Fall 2023) and applied cryptography class (Fall 2022)
- I regularly competed in nationals robotics competitions during undergrad.
- I've been freelancing for a while, and I've had the opportunity to wear many hats in a wide variety of teams. I'm extremely adept at picking up new technologies, and I love learning about new things!
